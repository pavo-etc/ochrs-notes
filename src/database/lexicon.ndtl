	BREF : About this website.
	BODY
		This site is the personal wiki and {projects project archive} of Zach Manson, built with Ochrs.
		It is a fork of <a href="https://nchrs.xyz">Nchrs</a> by Clemens Scott, which is itself a fork of <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/">XXIIVV</a> by Devine Lu Linvega.
		I chose to base this site on Nchrs as it eschewed the migration to Uxntal that XXIIVV underwent.  As interesting as Uxntal is, I do not know how to write or maintain it. This site consists of static HTML pages generated by a single-file C program based on a few simple databases.
		The databases are in the human-readable plaintext formats ~Tablatal~ and ~Indental~.
		It loads no JavaScript or any type of external content. It is built with simplicity, resilience and efficiency in mind. It can be viewed offline without the need of extra tools or local servers.
		The sitemap can be found on the {404} page.
		### Dependencies
		To build the website, a bash script called `build.sh` needs to be executed. It compiles `main.c`, runs the executable that outputs the content of `databases/lexicon.ndtl` and `databases/glossary.ndtl` to single HTML files and finally removes the executable again. `clang-format` formats the code before compilation.
		This site supports responsive images and lazyloading to preserve bandwidth. The original images are stored in `src/media/` and are converted to appropriate sizes and dithered by the `batchVariants` bash script using imagemagick.
		GIFs are converted the MP4 using `ffmpeg` within the `makeVideo` script.
		All of the above scripts are executed when the `deploy.sh` is called. Additionally this script pushes the site to the deployed branch.

SNAKEWARE
	HOST : projects
	BREF : A Linux-based operating system with a pure Python userspace.
	BODY
		snakeware is an experimental OS with developed in 2020.  Its userspace is written entirely in Python, barring a single Busybox root process.  It was created by Joshua Moore drawing inspiration from the Commodore 64.  The window manager, snakewm, is written primarily with pygame_gui.  It is not based on X11 or Wayland, instead writing directly to the framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`).

		On first boot, snakeware launches you directly a the Python interpreter.  From here you can run Python commands directly, launch the window manager, or launch CLI games.
		To launch snakewm from the interpreter, run the `snakewm` command.  From snakewm the aopp menu can be opened using the Super key.  From here a number of applications can be launched.

		To launch CLI games, enter the following commands:
		```
		>>> import snake_games
		>>> snake_games.menu()
		```
		Games included as of 2022 are snake, snakepaint, and circlez.

		### History

		snakeware was a short-lived project and should be considered inactive, with most significant contributions ending in 2020.  It was created and maintained by Joshua Moore and had a small number of contributors.  Some of the applications included in snakeware never reached their intended goals, such as the included terminal emulator snaketerm which is extremely rudimentary.

		One of the goals in making the entire userspace in Python was to make it modifiable by the user with little effort.  As Python is intepreted, all code for the window manager and the interface would be visible and modifiable by any snakeware user, and would be easy to extend.  Unfortunately, the planned text editor for snakeware, CATH, was never finished.

		Other planned projects were networking, a chat application, and a package system built on top of PyPI called snakeoil.

		The project was coordinated over a Discord server, though this hasn't been active for some time.

COVID19 TRACKER
	HOST : projects
	BREF : A dashboard for COVID-19 updates in Western Australia.
	BODY
		<a href="https://tracker.zachmanson.com">tracker.zachmanson.com</a> was written in early 2022 to serve as a simple dashboard to visualise the number of COVID-19 infections in Western Australia.  

		It was borne of mild frustration on how difficult it was to find the number of locally spread cases that had been identified overnight, as opposed to imported cases.  During the first few months of WA's this distinction was critical to understanding how quickly the virus was spreading, thought wasn't present in the State Governments own dashboard.  They only reported this statistic on their daily(ish) press releases.

		My tracker scrapes these press releases, stores them, produces a simple plot of the case numbers and generates a static website based on the data.  The script is written in Python using Beautiful Soup to scrape the data, matplotlib to create plots and jinja for the templating.  This is run every 20 minutes and served using nginx.

		The project has been broken since September 2022, as the government switched to only reporting weekly numbers.`

ALCULATOR
	HOST : projects
	BREF : An alternate frontend for Dan Murphy's
	BODY
		<a href="https://alculator.zachmanson.com">Alculator</a> was written in the waning days of 2022 to determine the cheapest drinks at Dan Murphy's, per standard drink. The site is build with Next.js and hosted on Vercel.

		If you click on the title bar there is a hidden interface used for debugging and finding data anomalies.

		## Dan's API

		Dan Murphy's website is a bloated Angular project but the public APIs used by the site have little to no security. After some mild poking around I was able to determine the routes needed and the general schema in use. Annoyingly, their APIs seemed designed around serving data that the frontend could display with almost little to no modification, rather than serving data in a logical format.
		
		For example, for any given product, the site will send a JSON object.  This will contain 3 different prices for the product for the different pack sizes you can purchase them in.  These are labelled `caseprice`, `singleprice`, and `inanysixprice`. Case price, understably, represents the price of a case.  A case of Gage Roads Pipe Dreams Coastal Lager Bottles may have a caseprice of $31.55, but the only way to know how many bottles are in this case are in a field called `caseprice.Message`.  This is actually a string, that *usually* says something like "case (24)", when it should obviously just be an associated int called something like `caseprice.units`.
		
		`singleprice` and `inanysixprice` are even worse, as they are used semi-interchangably. `singleprice` tends to represent the price of a single bottle, and `inanysixprice` tends to represent the price of a single bottle in a pack of 6.  Althought sometimes it's a pack of 4.  Or 8.  When `singleprice` isn't undefined, `singleprice` sometimes refers to the price of a pack of 6.  The only way to know for sure is by checking if `singleprice?.PackType === "Pack"` or `singleprice?.PackType === "Bottle"`.  And of course, when `singleprice` does mean a pack, the number of units is *usually* stored in a string.
 
		This is all in service of avoiding frontend rendering logic as much as possible.  Perhaps this is why their API server is so horrendously slow. It can take minutes to return a list of 500 drinks, and times out easily.  To get all of their products (1000+ beers, 6000+ red wines) in my script I needed to sequentially chain queries in batches of 100 drinks.

		The data itself is riddled with mistakes an inconsistencies. "Standard Drinks" is inconsistently used in packs, where usually it represents a single unit and <a href="https://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/808932">occasionally it represents the sum of all the units</a>.  Sometimes fields are just completely wrong (<a href="https://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/194571">White Bay Brewing Alcohol Volume especially bad</a>), or use values for bottles of different sizes (<a href="https://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/907223">350mL bottle with 11 standards</a>). These products are collected in the <a href="https://github.com/pavo-etc/alculator/blob/main/science/blacklist.json">`blacklist.json`</a> file and ignored by the script that downloads the catalogue.

		<a href="https://github.com/pavo-etc/alculator/blob/main/science/api.js">The final script</a> is warty and takes about 15 minutes to run, but converts the data to a sane schema.  This script is run daily via GitHub Action, and the new data is directly stored in JSON files and committed to the repo.  This is inefficient, but meant I didn't have to mess around with databases in my deployment.  I do hope to one day set up a proper database for this.

		Firefox Proton brought many lovely features, but I deeply prefer the Photon tab design.  Luckily, Proton supports applying CSS styling to window elements like the tab bar.

		1. Open `about:config`
		2. Find for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`, set its value to true.
		3. Open `about:support` and go to the directory marked "Profile Directory" or "Profile Folder".
		4. Create file `<profile directory>/chrome/userChrome.css` with custom stylesheet, e.g.
		```
		.tab-background {
			border-radius: 0px 0px !important;
			margin-bottom: 0px !important;
			margin-top: 0px !important;
		}

		.tabbrowser-tab:not([selected=true]):not([multiselected=true]) .tab-background {
			background-color: color-mix(in srgb, currentColor 0%, transparent);
		}

		## Em Size

		Em size is a unit defined by the height of characters.  It is used in font sizing in typography, and consequently is used in web development.  The origin of the name "em" is from metal type printing, where the "m" character type happened to be a square.  While in the past this was a physical property of the "m" type, in modern design contexts it is an arbitrary size representing the "design space" of a digital font.  This means the actual height of text in pixels can vary between fonts, despite having the same em size.

		More on this can be read <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/font-size/">here</a>.

		## GECOS

		When creating a new user account using the `adduser` program on Unix machines there is a field called GECOS that conventionally used to store information about the user, such as their real name or phone number.
		```
		adduser 
			[options] 
			[--home DIR]
			[--shell SHELL]
			[--no-create-home]
			[--uid ID]
			[--firstuid ID]
			[--lastuid ID]
			[--ingroup GROUP | --gid  ID] 
			[--disabled-password] 
			[--disabled-login]
			[--gecos GECOS]
			[--add_extra_groups]
			[--encrypt-home] user

		--gecos GECOS
		Set  the  gecos  field for the new entry generated.  adduser will not ask for finger 
		information if this option is given.
		```

		The cryptic title is not explained in the man pages.  This field is called GECOS as it was originally used to describe the purpose of machines running the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Comprehensive_Operating_System">General Electric Comprehensive Operating System</a> (GECOS), which had user accounts set up to access the services running on those machines, such as print spooling.  This field was added to `/etc/passwd`, and was later repurposed to contain identifying information on each user.  This anachronism has managed to persist into modern Unix and Linux system to this day.

		## Referer HTTP Field
		"Referer" is a field in the HTTP request headers that contains the previous page that linked to the requested page. This misspelling of the word "referrer" was present in the original proposal for the field in the HTTP specification, made by Phillip Hallam-Baker. This spelling was then widely implemented by the software of the time, and solidified by RFC 1945 which documented the HTTP/1.0 protocol as it was being comtemporarily used.

		More details on this can be found on this field and its etymology on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">Wikipedia entry</a>.

		## Dotfiles Being Hidden
		On Unix systems a file can be hidden from `ls` and other applications by prefixing the filename with a period.  This was introduced in Unix Version 2 as a side-effect of adding  files `.` and `..` to support the new hierarchical filesystem.  To avoid these navigation files appearing in every directory when `ls` was executed, filenames with the first character `'.'` were filtered out.  This unintentionally hid other files with this prefix. Once this precedent was set, other programs implemented the same behaviour, which continues to this day.
